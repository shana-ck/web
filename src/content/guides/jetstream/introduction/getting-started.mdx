# Getting Started

[`@skyware/jetstream`](https://npmjs.com/package/@skyware/jetstream) is a utility library for consuming data from a [Jetstream](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream) instance.

## Setup

```ts twoslash
import { Jetstream } from "@skyware/jetstream";

const jetstream = new Jetstream();
```

The `Jetstream` class takes an object parameter with the following properties:

- `wantedCollections`: An array of collections to subscribe to events for. This can contain any collection name or wildcard strings such as `app.bsky.feed.*` to receive events for all collections whose name starts with `app.bsky.feed.`. If not provided or empty, you will receive events for all collections.
- `wantedDids`: An array of DIDs to subscribe to events for. If not provided or empty, you will receive events for all DIDs.
- `cursor`: The Unix timestamp in microseconds to start listening from. A cursor is included in every event emitted as the `time_us` property. If you don't provide a cursor, the class will start listening from the most recent event.
- `endpoint`: The subscription URL of the Jetstream instance to connect to. Defaults to `wss://jetstream.atproto.tools/subscribe`.

## Handling events

```ts twoslash
declare const jetstream: import("@skyware/jetstream").Jetstream;
// ---cut---
jetstream.onCreate("app.bsky.feed.post", (event) => {
	console.log("New post:", event.commit.record.text)
});
```

Jetstream allows you to subscribe to a filtered feed of events related to specific collections. The <Reference to="/docs/jetstream/classes/Jetstream"/> class has three useful methods for listening for commits:
- <Reference to="/docs/jetstream/classes/Jetstream#onCreate" type="Method">onCreate</Reference>: Listen for new records created in a collection.
- <Reference to="/docs/jetstream/classes/Jetstream#onUpdate" type="Method">onUpdate</Reference>: Listen for updated records in a collection.
- <Reference to="/docs/jetstream/classes/Jetstream#onDelete" type="Method">onDelete</Reference>: Listen for deleted records in a collection.

The class also emits broader events.

```ts twoslash
declare const jetstream: import("@skyware/jetstream").Jetstream;
// ---cut---
import { CommitType } from "@skyware/jetstream";

// Listen for all commits, regardless of collection
jetstream.on("commit", (event) => {
	if (event.commit.operation === CommitType.Create) {
		console.log("create in ", event.commit.collection, event.commit.record);
	} else if (event.commit.operation === CommitType.Update) {
		console.log("update in", event.commit.collection, event.commit.rkey);
	} else if (event.commit.operation === CommitType.Delete) {
		console.log("delete in", event.commit.collection, event.commit.rkey);
	}
});

// Listen for account status updates
jetstream.on("account", (event) => {
	console.log("account update", event.account.status)
});

// Listen for identity updates
jetstream.on("identity", (event) => {
	console.log("identity update", event.account.did)
});
```

Using Jetstream over a [direct Relay connection](/docs/firehose) can help you save bandwidth and only receive the events you care about.

### A Note on Types

When using method such as <Reference to="/docs/jetstream/classes/Jetstream#onCreate" type="Method">onCreate</Reference>, the type of the event will be inferred from the collection name. However, you may encounter an error resulting in missing properties on the record object. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` has the following:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"moduleResolution": "node16", // or nodenext
	}
}
```

## Event Reference

The `Jetstream` class may emit the following events:

### Update events
